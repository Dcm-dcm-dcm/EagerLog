You will see a log window of {file_system} separated by line breaks. It is known that the system is in {state} state during the current log window. Your task is to interpret the reason for the system being in {state} state based on the observed logs using the given rules.

# Rules:
    [Normal] State:
        1.  The logs show routine system operations with no error indications.
        2.  Performance metrics, such as CPU usage and memory, are within normal ranges.
        3.  Security logs do not report any suspicious or malicious activities.
        4.  Some issues that the system can automatically repair are not included in the analysis.
    [Abnormal] State:
        1.  Error logs or failed operations are present in the logs.
        2.  Performance metrics indicate issues, such as high load or memory leaks.
        3.  Security logs show potential risks like failed logins or unusual access patterns.
        4.  Anomalous behavior from users or system components may contribute to the abnormal state.
