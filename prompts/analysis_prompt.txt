You will be given a window of {file_system} logs separated by newlines. Based on the current window of logs, you are required to predict whether the system is in a [normal] or [abnormal] state, along with a written description of your reasoning. We will also provide preceding or similar context logs along with the relevant evidence of the system's state during those log entries for your reference.

# Notes:

    1. The system itself has a certain degree of fault tolerance, so even though some logs may contain error messages, it does not necessarily mean that the system is in an [Abnormal] state.
    2. Please carefully compare the provided evidence and the input logs to infer the abnormal state.
    3. When comparing, focus on the text, and you may selectively ignore some differences in numbers.
